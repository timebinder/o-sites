A very interesting and useful workshop!.
It helped me to understand my feelings and how I can control my negative thoughts and recharge my energies.
Gavriel knows how to make people feel comfortable and create an atmosphere where everybody can express their emotions.
There were very nice people and we exchanged our experiences.
Thank you, Gavriel for sharing your knowledge and thank you to everybody who opened their hearts yesterday. I look forward to the next workshop and I will be listening to my heart and breathing.

Just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this workshop. It was an extremely enlightening evening and opened my eyes to things I was completely unaware of.  Gavriel is very personable and explains things well. I am looking forward to attending next week.

Jacquie, Trainer

Coaching Feedback
“I met a transformational Life Coach in Bali. 

After 5 coaching sessions with him, I came home a completely different person in ways I could never explain and many that I can.
After years of therapy and years of Landmark, Gavriel’s coaching filled in the missing gaps for me!

I never thought I would meet a Life coach who could make the kind of difference that he did, nor did I expect I would recommend someone like this to my friends."

Anytime I speak to you things seem to spontaneously happen so I wanted to phone you and say thank you."

Lauren

Where were you in my earlier life. Everything you say is like a band aid but such a good one…
I feel like ‘oh that makes total sense’ and I feel good about it. 

Seriously if I was rich you’d be my life coach for life!

Unless berry smoothies are your thing…

This is bringing tears to my eyes….you have drawn my brain! I see you also have a philosophy and mathematics/physics background. This is a true Hurculean effort to bring these concepts to those who weren’t as fortunate to be properfly steered….. The cueing synapsed parts of my brain that I supposed were long atrophied. These charts alone are a true blessing…..Again, my sincerest thanks.

Hello Gavriel, Just want to say I am happy you are on the net. I find your material to be awesome.

Leigh Colbourne

I find your maps to life very useful and enlightening to say the least. You put life in perpective. Once you see it you can see your own life at a glance and will know where you need to improve. I find it very educating. Thank You.
John Mileg

I have alot of clutter to sort through and have difficulty with decision making. Your attachment looks excellent. I think it will help alot with decision-making and recognizing hurdles. Being set out with small steps I think will help me overcome inertia.
Colleen

I was intrigued by what appeared to be something different and perhaps more effective then the GTD approach?

It seems your system has a more organic/natural and complete feel to it.

Richard

My email address gets hammered with spam and worthless offers, but your products are worth 100, 1000; maybe even a million times anything I’ve seen advertised in my email inbox.

Curtis Ah Shay

I am reading your book, and I can relate to very much of it… Your folderarchy solution is something I’ve dreamed about all my adult life. I would like to remain in touch and keep you updated on my progress. We’ll speak soon.

Shebah

This is “GREAT STUFF”. I was printing it and the ink cartridge ran out. I printed, folded and stapled the pages into a booklet. I’ve read thru it once already!! So Exhilarating!!
Teddy Antoine

Thank you Gavriel, I spent another hour reviewing your links and think you are reaching the paydirt of our evolution. …

Your folderarchy is a dynamic set of imperatives. And as I vigorously build my own power base I am sure to download later versions to increase my own widening control.

Jeffrey

"I consider your book to be much more in touch with reality than either celestine prophecy or a course in miracles both of which I found to contain high levels of mysticism. Perhaps I read them wrongly? Yours is real and presents a stark real choice – get up off yer ass and do something for ourselves or die pathetically. I loved it. Hard hitting, accurate, proveable, compassionate. Great mix. Rare mix. I thought so anyway." - Craig

"..'Celestine Prophecy'.. ' A Course in Miracles'. May I say yours ranks right up there with them. Keep on keeping people thinking" 

Dr Ron MacIntyre

..I keep reading all of these crazy books talking about writing down goals and such. My favorite of all time is the Science of Getting Rich.
For some reason my ego thinks that it seems to easy, to good to be true, you know. To just get a clear vision of want you want. I find it hard to really focus on my objectives. Usually, I get glimpses of them, during a certain song or something, but never for long.
The questionnaires are a project. I seem to be able to get to deeper states of focus when I do the questionnaires. I guess because I got something to finish. I don’t really know. But they do good for me. I need to live my dreams, and the questionnaires help me focus on the goals and the steps to complete them.
Thanks Gav, great stuff
D Thompson

Wow, I think Ill read this twice!!
Jesse Hight

I simply have to respond to this email, even at this stage. I am amazed at the power projected forth from your words. They were a welcome relief to the regular conversation we have all come to expect in our routine lives. I just had to say that. It felt like it does when you come home after a long and tiresome adventure… I know I know I am getting carried away but had to say it… Thanks for the delivery.

This product package is everything it promises and more.
According to Maslow, the highest happiness and fuldillment of purpose is reached when one self actualized. Your Life Direction Clarifier is fantastic.
I have been able to experience the greatest and most fulfilling life. More than I could have ever imagined.
By gaining insight into what I truly wanted for myself and not just reaching and achieving goals by society’s standards, i have actualized many experiences that would have taken multiple lifetimes.
My time was not wasted pursuing and achieving a lifestyle that was shallow and not for me.
I recommend this product and I continue to use it to stay on the course of my choosing or choosing another. That is true freedom.
Thank you Mr. Shaw!
Barbara Nwosu

I have received so much from you people. Thank you. I have received 2 e-mails from you and they were loaded. Can I receive more? I sure would like to. Thanks for whatever you do.

I’d like too thank Gavriel for all the assistance he’s provided over the previous 5 Years and continues to provide. His research on most topics has been incredibly inspiring!

Very very well done! I wish I had found your site a year ago! Thanks to your handbook, I will never be able to hide behind ignorance again. I will know that if I don’t make progress from here it is because I choose inaction. I can tell you put your heart, soul, and brain into it.

"I am doing very well... I have bigger dreams and bigger realities.

I continue to process and gain greater control. Obstacles are falling away or destroyed. Outside suppression and lack of resources is decreasing as I become aware of them. 

I am exploring myself much more and the feat of defeat has decreased”

I’ve had the magnificent opportunity to meet an exceptional visionary, that has the ideal lifestyle we all dream about, but only a few dare emulate. Check out Gavriel Shaw’s web page. His is a lifestyle I know I’d like to try on for size. He is helping me change my life, maybe he can help yours too?

Wow Gav. I cant believe u wrote that. You answered many of my conflicts that I have battled through unconsciously for many years. That article defines the solutions to many things that I have done wrong throughout the years. Great lesson learned. I am going to be reading that over and over again.

"You are one of the most amazing human beings I have had the pleasure to meet, eat with, and exchange conversation. Your value to the world we live is immense. If it wasn’t for your unreasonable influence I’m not sure I would be half the man that I am today. Thank you sir!"

Reader Feedback for a Short Novel
Below are comments about a short dystopian story I wrote way back in 1998 titled "I Am Earth's Survivor" available now at www.gavrielshaw.com/survivor

I’m a film editor in Hollywood..
I just discovered [your site] when I ran across a note you posted on Economic Rebels Forum back in November.
I love your Special Bonus Report … I’ve just spent a couple of hours on your site. Wow! What great content. I want to read everything you’ve written.

J B

I thought it was very true and insightful. The reason I can see this is because I was raised with extreme religious beliefs. Nothing else was right. Yet there were men of the church that molested me and contradicted everything I was being taught. A couple were preachers. Ive been suffering from depression for some time and Ive been trying to break free from the one sided and contradictive teachings of my childhood. Im 42 years old and fill so trapped and helpless.
M.

I really enjoyed your latest article [Self-Leaders Bottom Line]. This sentence, “All we need to be is the angel or the father christmas who hands them the greatest possible present in human history.. Neothink Power.” made me cry.

Tony Pretenhoffer

Thank You Very much!!!!! I belive these offers + Neothink will = a much better life for me, as well as a way to put what I have learned from Neothink to better use.

Anna

As I get further into your read (only 1/4 read so far) I can feel something starting to stir inside me. I have one word right now that best describes – AWAKEN

Peter

Your Last Man Standing piece of Art/Writing was easy to read. It had enormous information all bundled into a concise script. My soul was reflected in your writing.
Paul

Dare I state this opinion? Neo-Tech might very well be one of the portals of your knowledge base, but I dare say that you’ve transcended into a new category all together!

You writings indicate a synthesis of both knowledge and intent that might well be forcasting a Gestault of the future!

purpleshadow

I found this book to be very interesting – Sad to say it paints a dark picture of our future… Ah but it is only a warning you say…there is hope, yes, even a light at the end of the tunnel you say.

So I will continue to investigate the 6 gifts…and it is with interest that I watch the continued saga called “Life on Earth”.
We did this to ourselves – if only we could wake-up…the cockroaches have been working real hard to keep us under thumb.
I have seen the ideas presented elsewhere but your form is much more concise and to the point.
Well done – let us intend that what you present comes to fruition.
Steve

Yes. I liked it. Ayn Rand’s ideas are a rich source for a very similar philosophical stand…. Rand, Wallace, Shaw, and me. To avoid Anthem, and “I am Earth’s Survivor”, it needs to be recognized that we are living Atlas Shrugged.
Richard David

I’m very excited about it all. by the way i did like very much i hope we can change be fore its to late!!!
Steven

Hi Gav, Your story was astonishing and with your astute links to valuable backgrounds including your own values at impressive sites you build I was kept very busy for two full days. There are many of us ‘scientific workers’ to quote Nietzsche going very hard to try to bring about a Supercivilisation result. Your document was chilling and motivating and informative. . .I am restructuring my office and living space out of inspiration from your organizing suggestions. Thank you for your excellence and contribution. May we see the New World emerge through your careful ongoing guidance. On to Zon!
Jeffrey

Yes gav. i can relate very much. still reading. i’m a slow reader. gotta say, the title didnt catch my attention [Editor: we worked out Peter didn’t like the reference to 2020 so I have removed it from the current version’s title to see how people respond] but once i started reading…wow. good read. keep up the good work. positive message.
Peter

I took the time to re-read survival 2020 again, once you start it is impossible to stop. I believe it was a few years back when I first had the privilege. Amazing Gav, a very inspiring discourse that helps us to keep focused, placing the big picture in perspective is necessary every now and then.

I had not seen part B until now and I was delighted and surprised… Thank you for all your efforts.
Alcides Mendez

I’m anxiously reading everything on this new philosophy. I am curious about what the precise information and tools are that will result in manifestation of ones dreams. In addition I am also curious how these changes would come about in the world that seems most firmly rooted in the status quo. Changing the paradigm of everyday life and the comfort of the world as people know it is a daunting task at best.
Lennie

Thank you! Yes, of course, I read it with much anxiety and encouragement as it resonated with my inner being in a big way as it touched on feelings that I dare not express to any of my friends. It was indeed very interesting reading and I hope that many others will have the same sentiment.
Claire

I read the whole thing and I believe in its power wholeheartedly!
Richard

"After coming back to your site 3 or 4 times I got as far as reading your testimonials. They gave me goose bumps. I had to get up from my computer and find another task to do. I felt like I was being spoken to from beyond."
Cathy

I value your story and the ideas. Making an understanding, clear with the Sanskrit meaning of Karma (cause and effect). Take that to the acid test within emotions and see what I see. Go to a civilization of independent freedom and grow to being the one in his own right, and the connection to your book is within. On glory way to be then me.
Nick

The book is really good, I agree with it in all areas! I took my brain back year ago from the programming that was imbedded in me from birth. These control freaks do not like it much, but hey it is my brain, my body, and I reprogrammed it to my liking. I believe in peace, love and harmony and I do have a vision of a super society, one whom works together with no violence, just peace, one society in tune with the Universe and its great plan for us.
Trina

I finished reading your ebook. I got distracted for a little while because I followed your links and did some more reading. I’ve read most of the materials online about Neo-Tech, the ones I could find anyway… well I still have ‘The Book’ to read. I found your ebook to be very straight forward and easy to read. You didn’t pull many punches and I liked that. Your writing is more true to the writings of Neo-Tech. You were honest, straightforward and positive about your approach. You write with confidence, you know what you’re talking about. I agree with everything you had to say and thought the layout of the material was very well thought out. You went into just enough detail to catch the readers attention, although I may be a little bias because of my prior Neo-Tech knowledge, but I liked it very much and it should help the revolution tremendously!
Bill Smith

Just went thru the book again. I admire your intelligence and writing skills. I have been, for a long time now. The cover story of Earth’s Survivor is definitely real/possible if we don’t act right now.
Ozzie Freedom

Dear sir I found your book very interesting section A was very sad and depressing describing the ant-civilisation down with the parasites section B the complete opposite the wonderful supercivilisation rid of all authorities and full of value producers/ creators for every body to flourish and prosper very exciting indeed.
Terry

I will share your story. Many of the folks I communicate with on the net are on the same thought and action plane.
Crest

The book itself is very unique, I like how it’s a mixture of speculative fiction and bullet-pointed non-fiction. It is ambitious and quite timely, for I also believe that the time for freedom-focused individuals to act is now, and the coercively violent ‘powers that be’ know their time is running out and so they are accelerating their plan of tyranny. So it is crucial that Truth gets out to the masses to offer an alternative to the manufactured lies.
Darren

What an epiphany!!

Teddy Antoine

I have read it and it was interesting, almost as interesting as nouveau tech package of inner circle secrets. Now if I can figure how to apply all of this info.

Joe

Yes I liked it, I`ve already read neo-tech 3 times, and this is another confimation of what it teaches, I`m still in the process of figuring out the wealth part

Sean

Are you Frank R Wallace?
Doug

After reading your short ebook I feel like You are my new cornerman and I am a heavyweight fighter and with your knowledge of the fightgame and my raw power we own that heavyweight title. YOUR FREIND FOREVER DAN THE DESTROYER.
Dan

I can definitely see things coming down to this. It just makes me stop and think in which ways I can get involved to help change things.
Randall Overbey

It was touching and summed up many key concepts of Neo-Tech. Although speculative in nature, your story could very well take place, as it derives from the essential and commonlly overlooked injustices in this world. I’m glad that there are writers out there who are greatly influenced by Neo-Tech.
Jack N

I found your story fitted my own views on the world situation almost perfectly.
Norm

Just finished browsing your site and my complements to you. I’m a long time NT reader. Do you hire into your company, or is it a bantam-style set up like at NTP??? Anyway, I sure hope your predictions for the 2008 elections come to pass. Take care.
Jake

I read your publication and saw where many parts are very true. I need more time to digest the material. I usually read a few times so I’m not missing anything. I would agree that if the world continues down its current path, there won’t be anything or anyone left.
